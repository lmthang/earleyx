Are tourists enticed by these attractions threatening their very existence ?
The two young sea-lions took not the slightest interest in our arrival .
They were playing on the jetty , rolling over and tumbling into the water together , entirely ignoring the human beings edging awkwardly round them .
Our party then had to step gingerly over hundreds of marine iguanas basking on the rocks , strange creatures with richly coloured velvet coats , looking like something between a giant lizard and a miniature dinosaur , and found nowhere else on earth except here in the Galapagos .
A little further on were the blue-footed boobies , birds with brilliant china-blue feet , again unique .
And then there were the flightless cormorants , birds with vestigial wings who , over the generations , have lost the ability to fly because the nutrients at the shoreline are so rich they have no need to leave .
The island of Fernandina lies at the far western edge of the Galapagos archipelago , dominated by a volcano that last erupted only six years ago , and home to some of the most remarkable wildlife in the world .
It was late afternoon on one of the last days of the year , and we had come ashore to scramble round the rough dark lava rocks of Punta Espinosa on the island .
In the golden afternoon light , with the moon rising above the volcanoes on Isabela Island across the strait , we could be forgiven for thinking that we were guests in paradise .
The creatures you see in the Galapagos are remarkable in their rarity .
